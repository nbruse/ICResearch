# ICResearch
A toolset of functions that I wrote for my coworkers and myself.

align - this aligns all of your data to a day of your chosing for a list of markers. Days can be determined per patient/row. 
binning - this creates bins of days from your data by using the mean. It can run all availble markers in one turn and is integrated with aligning and therefore can be run directly afterwards.
